    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>November 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Welcome to Newsphere.</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Newsphere</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (<em>the App</em>) and related services.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> account info (email), preferences, topics you follow, feedback, or messages to support.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected data:</strong> device model, OS version, app usage metrics, crash reports, IP address, and analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Content and reading data:</strong> articles you open, read, save, or share to improve personalization and recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> data we receive from analytics providers or news content partners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver and personalize news, recommendations, and AI-powered summaries and deep dives.</li>
      <li>Send notifications and alerts for topics you choose.</li>
      <li>Improve and analyze app performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Features</h2>
    <p>Newsphere uses AI to generate summaries, insights, and content recommendations based on the articles and topics you follow. The AI processes article text and user preferences to produce concise summaries and suggestions. We do not use AI to create content that impersonates human authors; instead, it assists with summarization and personalization.</p>

    <h2>Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers (analytics, crash reporting, email delivery) who help operate the App.</li>
      <li>News content providers to fetch and display articles.</li>
      <li>Law enforcement or other parties when required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analytics & Advertising</h2>
    <p>We may use analytics services to understand app usage and improve the product. We do not show third-party behavioral advertising in the App by default. If advertising or targeted ads are enabled, we will disclose that and provide choices to opt out where applicable.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>We retain data as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data but cannot guarantee absolute security of information transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and correction:</strong> You can request to access, correct, or delete your personal data by contacting us (see below).</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Manage notification preferences in the app or via device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics opt-out:</strong> Some analytics can be disabled via in-app settings or device-level controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed or stored in the country where our servers or service providers operate. By using the App you consent to transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection laws.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy here with a revised effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about this policy or your data, contact:</p>
